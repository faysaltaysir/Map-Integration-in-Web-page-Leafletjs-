# Leaflet Map Example Documentation

This document provides an overview of a simple web page with a Leaflet map integrated. The map uses the OpenStreetMap tile layer, a custom marker, and a polygon to display geographical information.

## Overview

The HTML code creates a webpage that renders a map using the Leaflet JavaScript library. The map is centered on specific coordinates and includes a marker at those coordinates. A polygon is also added to the map to demonstrate additional Leaflet functionality.
